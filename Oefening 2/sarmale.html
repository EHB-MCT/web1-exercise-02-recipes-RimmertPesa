		<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
		<h3>For the filling:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				500g ground pork (you can also mix pork with beef or even use lamb)
			</li>
			<li>100g smoked bacon (optional for extra flavor)</li>
			<li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
			<li>100g uncooked rice</li>
			<li>1 egg (to bind the filling)</li>
			<li>2 tablespoons tomato paste or 100ml tomato sauce</li>
			<li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
			<li>1 teaspoon paprika (optional)</li>
			<li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
			<li>Fresh or dried dill (optional)</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>For the cabbage:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				1 large pickled cabbage (fermented/sour cabbage) or 2 small ones Note:
				If you use fresh cabbage, boil it for 5-10 minutes to soften the leaves.
			</li>
			<li>500g sauerkraut (optional, for layering between the rolls)</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>For the pot:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>3-4 bay leaves</li>
			<li>200g smoked sausages (optional)</li>
			<li>200ml tomato juice or tomato paste diluted with water</li>
			<li>Water or stock (enough to cover the rolls in the pot)</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Instructions:</h2>
		<h3>1. Prepare the cabbage:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>If using pickled cabbage, rinse the leaves to remove excess salt.</li>
			<li>
				Carefully separate the cabbage leaves, cutting out the thick central
				vein from each leaf to make rolling easier.
			</li>
			<li>If the leaves are too large, cut them in half.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>2. Prepare the filling:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				In a pan, sauté the finely chopped onion in a little oil until softened.
			</li>
			<li>
				Add the rice and cook for another 2-3 minutes to lightly toast it.
			</li>
			<li>
				In a large bowl, mix the ground pork, sautéed onion and rice, smoked
				bacon, egg, tomato paste, thyme, paprika, salt, pepper, and dill.
				Combine well.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>3. Roll the cabbage:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Take a cabbage leaf, place a small amount of the meat mixture (around
				1-2 tablespoons, depending on the size of the leaf) near the base, fold
				in the sides, and roll tightly.
			</li>
			<li>Repeat until all the meat filling is used up.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>4. Layer the sarmale:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				In a large pot or Dutch oven, line the bottom with a few whole cabbage
				leaves (to prevent the rolls from sticking).
			</li>
			<li>If using sauerkraut, scatter a layer over the cabbage leaves.</li>
			<li>
				Arrange the cabbage rolls in layers, placing bay leaves and smoked
				sausage (if using) between the layers.
			</li>
			<li>
				Once all the rolls are in the pot, pour the tomato juice or diluted
				tomato paste over the rolls, and add enough water or stock to cover
				them.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>5. Cook the sarmale:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Bring the pot to a simmer on the stove.</li>
			<li>
				Once simmering, reduce the heat to low, cover, and let it cook for 2 to
				3 hours. Check periodically to ensure there's enough liquid. Add water
				if needed.
			</li>
			<li>
				For a more intense flavor, you can cook the sarmale in the oven at 170°C
				(340°F) for 2-3 hours after simmering for 30 minutes on the stove.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>6. Serve:</h3>
		<ul>
			Sarmale are often served with sour cream on the side and a chunk of crusty
			bread or polenta (mămăligă).
		</ul>
		<h2>Enjoy!</h2>
