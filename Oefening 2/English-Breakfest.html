		<h1>English Breakfest</h1>
		<img src="Beelden/english_breakfest.jpg" alt="" />
		<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>4 sausages (Cumberland, pork, or your favorite)</li>
			<li>
				4 rashers of bacon (preferably back bacon or streaky if you prefer
				crispy)
			</li>
			<li>2 large eggs</li>
			<li>4 medium tomatoes (halved)</li>
			<li>200g mushrooms (sliced)</li>
			<li>
				200g baked beans (one small can, ideally British-style beans in tomato
				sauce)
			</li>
			<li>4 slices of bread (for toast)</li>
			<li>Butter (for toast and frying)</li>
			<li>Salt and pepper (to taste)</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Instructions:</h2>
		<h3>1. Prepare the sausages:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Heat a large frying pan over medium heat.</li>
			<li>
				Add a small amount of oil or butter, then cook the sausages for about
				10-12 minutes, turning frequently until browned and cooked through.
			</li>
			<li>Once done, set aside and keep warm.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>2. Cook the bacon:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				In the same pan, cook the bacon to your desired crispiness. This should
				take 3-4 minutes on each side for back bacon, or longer if you like it
				crispy.
			</li>
			<li>Set the bacon aside and keep warm.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>3. Cook the mushrooms:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Add a little butter to the pan, followed by the sliced mushrooms.</li>
			<li>Saut√© for 5-7 minutes until they are golden and softened.</li>
			<li>
				Season with a little salt and pepper, then remove from the pan and keep
				warm.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>4. Cook the tomatoes:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>In the same pan, place the halved tomatoes cut side down.</li>
			<li>
				Cook for 3-4 minutes until they begin to soften and caramelize.
				Optionally, flip them over to lightly cook the skin side.
			</li>
			<li>Remove and set aside.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>5. Heat the baked beans:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Warm the baked beans in a small pot over medium-low heat, stirring
				occasionally until hot.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>6. Fry the eggs:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>In a separate non-stick pan, heat a little butter or oil.</li>
			<li>
				Crack the eggs into the pan and fry them sunny-side up, or flip them if
				you prefer them over-easy. Cook until the whites are set but the yolks
				are still runny (or to your preferred doneness).
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>7. Assembly:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Place the sausages, bacon, mushrooms, tomatoes, and baked beans onto the
				plate.
			</li>
			<li>Add your fried eggs on top or to the side.</li>
			<li>
				Serve with buttered toast and a cup of tea or coffee for a full English
				breakfast experience!
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Enjoy!</h2>
